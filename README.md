## Students
Design classes that represent students and their courses. 
***
Use an abstract class to represent the general properties and methods of students, and then create 
specific classes for different types of students (e.g. bachelors, masters). Implement methods for 
adding and removing students from courses, calculating the average score, and displaying information about students.
